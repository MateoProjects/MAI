Conclusions\n","As it is represented by the resulting 0.45 pearson correlation, Jaccard simmilarity with raw words is far from the Gold Standard similarity measure, but shares some correlation.\n","<br>\n","It can be deduced that similarity measures based on raw words have many problems. One of the most fragrants is the fact that even nearly identical words (such as \"paragraph\" and \"paragraphs\") are considered different.\n","<br><br>\n","We expect to learn new and better methods in the future in order to be able to obtain results closer to the Gold Standard."]}]}
