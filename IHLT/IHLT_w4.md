# Introduction to Human Language Technologies POS tagging

## Goal and Motivation

* Morphological analysis provides lexical information related to forms (POS, nums, gen, tense,...) so the **goal** for a POS this disambiguate POS of part of speech.



## Open class vs. Closed class

**General classes**:

* Closed class: never invent new closed items ( functional words). Usual subclasses for indo-european languages:
  * prepositions, conjunctions, etc...
* Open class: new open items can be invented. Usual for subclasses for indo-european languages:
  * nouns, non-auxiliary verbs

Each language defines its particular set of subclasses.

Subclasses can be represented with a particular granularity.

## Stochastic methods

### Stochastic taggers

**Goal** 

Assign the most likely POS-tag sequence to a word sequence.
$$
W = w_1...w_n (a word sequence) \\
T = t_1...t_n (a POS-tag sequence) \\ to\ do
$$
**Markov model**

*X = (X1, ... ,XT)* sequence of random variables taking values in observed states *S = {s1, ... sn}

Sequence probabilty P(X)?

**Markov Properties**
