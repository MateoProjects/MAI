# Introduction to the Ultrasound Imaging

## **Basic principles**

a sound wave moving in air hits a solid surface, it reflects off it. We often call this reflected sound an echo. The same applies to a sound wave moving through water
and hitting an obstacle.
If we know the speed of sound in the air or water, we can calculate the distance to the obstacle. To do this we must measure the time taken for a pulse of sound to travel to the object and back again.

The distance to the object and back is given by $distance = speed·time$ and the distance only in one way is $$distance= \frac{speed · time}{2}$$

**Example**

A boat sends out an ultrasonic pulse to determine the depth of a shoal of fish. If the echo is received after 80 m (milliseconds), at what depth should the nets be trawled?

Speed of soun in water = 1500m/s so $distance = speed · time = \frac{1500·80}{1000}$ . This is the total distance. So the depth of shoal is $\frac{120}{2}=60m$

The frequencies of ultrasound required for medical image are in the range 1-20Mhz. For obtain this frequencies needs to be used piezoelectric material. 

## **Detection of ultrasound**
The piezoelectric effect also works in reverse. If the crystal is squeezed or stretched, an electric field is produced across it. So if ultrasound hits the crystal from outside, it will cause the crystal to vibrate in and out, and this will produce an alternating electric field.
The crystal can be used to detect any returning ultrasound which has been reflected from an obstacle. Normally the transmitting and receiving crystals are built into the same unit, which is a called an ultrasonic transducer.

The exact fraction of the incident sound which is transmitted or reflected depends on how different the two materials on each side of the boundary are. This is described by the acoustic impedance of the materials, which is related to the density of the material and the speed of sound in the material.

Because of the impedance difference between air and skin, you cannot just point the probe at the skin and get ultrasound to enter the body. A coupling medium is needed to match the impedance of the crystal in the probe more closely to the impedance of the skin of the patient. Nowadays the most common coupling medium is a film of oil smeared on the patient's skin.

**Attenuation**
The amplitude and intensity of the reflected signal is much lower than the emitted signal. The reasons are:
* The emitted energy is absorbed by the material.
* At each reflection between two media a part of the signal is bounced back to the probe.

**The ultrasound frequency should be a good trade-off between**
* Resolution
* Penetration
* Attenuation
* Tissues to be imaged

Increase the amplification of the reflected signal as the echo time (the depth) increases.

**Types of B-mode Ultrasound**

The speed of the image can reach up to 100 images per second.

2D piezoelectric arrays allow volumetric real-time scan. It is possible to make
multi-planar cuts retrospectively.

## **Doppler Ultrasonoro**

This modality consists in measuring the variation of frequencies (called "Dopple") between the wave transmitted by the transducer and one received from the red blood cells. 

* A higher frequency = blood approaches the transducer
* A lower frequency = blood move away from the transducer

## **Ultrasound Noise**

The medical Ultrasound B-scan image is acquired by summation of the echo signals from locally correlated scatterers in beam range.

Locally correlated multiplicative noises from small scatterers corrupt ultrasound image. These noises are commonly called “speckles”.

In many cases the speckle noise degrades the fine details and edge definition, limits the contrast resolution, limits the detect ability of small, low contrast lesions in body. And it should be filtered out
