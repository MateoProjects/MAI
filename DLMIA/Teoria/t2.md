# Magnetic Resonance Imaging

MRI is based on the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)

* Atoms with and off numbers of protons or neutrons have spin
* Moving electric charge, be it positive or negative, produces a magnetic field

MRI utilizes this magnetic spin property of protons of hydrogen to elicit images.

When a body is placed into the scanner, the strong magnetic field causes the individual hydrogen nuclei to either:
* ALIGN ANTI-PARALLEL TO THE MAIN MAGNETIC FIELD (B0) or
* ALIGN PARALLEL TO THE MAIN MAGNETIC FIELD (B0)

Due to the influence of Bo, the hydrogen nucleus “wobbles” or precesses (like a spinning top as it comes to rest).

The axis of the nucleus forms a path around Bo known as the “precessional path”. The speed at which hydrogen precesses depends on the strength of B0 and is termed the “precessional frequency”. The processional frequency of hidrogen is 63.86Mhz. The precessional paths of the individual hydrogen nucleus‟ is random, or “out of phase".

Resonance Occurs when an object is exposed to an oscillating perturbation that has a frequency close to its own natural frequency of oscillation.

Magnetic field known in MR as B1 which is a “pulse” applied during MR sequence
