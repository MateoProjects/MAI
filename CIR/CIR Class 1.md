## Human Robot Interaction

Systematic study of the interaction with robots.

**Types of Roles of Interaction**
* Supervisor
	* How many robots can a supervisor effectively monitor?
* Operator
	* Needs to have "telepresense" to understand where robot is and what must be done. 
* Teammate
	* Here people and robot are a different members of the team. 
	* Need to understand any limitations robot has in capabilities
	* Can the robot understand the same interaction vocabulary as the other team members?
* Mechanic / programmer
	* No need to comment anything about this.
* Bystander (Mandatory define this in our project)

We need to define a UI to support a given role.

* presence
