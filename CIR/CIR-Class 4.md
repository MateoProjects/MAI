# Human Robot Interaction S4

## Evaluation Methodologies
**Metrics**
- Task effectiveness: How well a Human-Robot team accomplishes
some task?
- Neglect tolerance: Autonomy of a robot with respect to some task
- Robot attention demand: How much a robot is demanding?
- Fan-out: Number of robots simultaneously operating

**Indicator for evaluating User experience**
- Embodiment: describes the relationship between a system and its environment and can be measured
by investigating the different perturbatory channels like morphology, which has impact on social
expectations.
- Emotion: The indicator emotion implies that people tend to interact with robots socially. Users may
experience satisfaction when a product fulfils the users’ expectations.
- Human-oriented perception: tries to simulate Human perception by tracking human features,
interpreting speech... but also communicating facial expressions
- Feeling of security: As soon as Humans collaborate together with robots in the same environment,
safety and security issues arise.
- Co-experience with robots: How individuals develop their personal experience based on social
interaction with others.

**Social impact**
- Quality of life, health and security: new therapy possibilities, security aspects...
- Working conditions and employment: includes all aspects affecting how people carry
out their job and how employers take care of their employees (working times,
organization...).
- Education: New software, new sciences and new disciplines require new types of
education. Preparation for utilization of robots, in the physical manner and in
psychological manner too.
- Cultural context: whole range of practices, customs and representations of a society.
Example: Japanese or South Koreans interact with robots in quite different manner
than in Europe.



## Study Design

Def: A supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point
for further investigation. You need to test and verify your hypothesis.

The null hypothesis
- Def: Is a general statement or default position that there is no association among groups, or no
relationship between two measured phenomena (one variable does not affect the other). It states the
results are due to chance and are not significant in terms of supporting the idea being investigated.
- Thus, the null hypothesis assumes that whatever you are trying to prove did not happen.

Alternative Hypothesis
- Def: Is a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for
further investigation. You need to test and verify your hypothesis

* Type of Variables

* Measurements

**A good measurement is accurate and repeatable.**

**Qualitative Data**
Important for understanding results and providing context for quantitative data.
- Collected through:
- Observations
- Interviews
- Open-ended survey questions
- Used in results to provide:
- Confirm or refuse hypothesis
- Case studies or User Studies regarding robot’s behaviors.
- Also, to provide demonstrable results.
- Have to be coded into quantitative data to analyze them.
- Important for demonstrating statistical significance:
- Results are generalizable beyond the participants.
- Results are more than just coincidence or chance.

**Advantages questionnaires**
1. Inexpensive: Are inexpensive.
2. Practical: Is a practical way to gather data.
3. Faster: Is a quick way to get results.
4. Scalability: Gather information from a large audience.
5. Comparability: it can be used to compare and contrast other research.
6. Easy Analysis and visualization: Are easy to put in chard and tables using statistical analysis.
7. Respondent anonymity: it is easy to maintain the responded anonymity.
8. Questionnaires can cover every aspect of a topic: you can ask many questions as you need.

**Disadvantages questionnaires**

1. Dishonest answers: Respondents may not be 100% truthful with their answers. variety of reasons…
2. Unanswered questions: make your survey short, to get better completion rates.
3. Differences in understanding and interpretation: Users may have different interpretations of your
questions or do not understand something.
4. Hard to convey feelings and emotions: Maybe you do not capture some hidden feelings if do not observe
participants behaviour.
5. Some questions are difficult to analyse: for example the open-ended questions .
6. Unconscientious responses: there’s no way to know if the respondent has really understood the question
or read it thoroughly before answering.
7. Questionnaire or survey fatigue: many questions or many time to fulfil the questioner.
