Models the way in which the beliefs are transmitted between the various hypotheses involved.

## Summary

**Strong points**

Consistent, systematic treatment of lack of knowledge with confidence intervals.

Gives information about the uncertainty and also about the belief on the different hypothesis.

Several hypothesis are managed at the same time.

**Weak points**

Difficulty on designing the “mass assignment” function for each real problem.
