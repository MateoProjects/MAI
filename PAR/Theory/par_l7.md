# Introduction to Approximate Reasoning

* Sometimes, things are not true or false, they can be fulfilled to some degree.

* Approximate reasoning deals with uncertainty and imprecision. 

## Uncertainty and Imprecision

Sentences can be more or less imprecise. 

If know that: “Temperature is above 20ºC”, what is the truth of the following sentences: 

1. “Temperature is 25ºC” 
   * Precise and uncertain 
2. “Temperature is higher than 15ºC” 
   * Imprecise and certain

## Models

* Probabilistic Approach
* Quasi-probabilistic methods: Certainty Factors
* Possibilistic Approach: Fuzzy Logic
* Existential Approach: Dempster-Shafer Theory

## Probability Theory

A branch of mathematics, the basis of Statistics. It deals with random variables, for which there is not a deterministic value.

Bayes Theorem gives a method to a probability "a posteriori" p(c|e)  . (e &rarr; c) where ***e*** is the evidence and ***c*** is the conclusion
$$
p(c|e) = \frac{p(e|c) · p(c)}{p(e)}
$$
