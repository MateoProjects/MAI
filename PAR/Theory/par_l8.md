# Introduction Approximate Reasoning

Approximate reasoning deals with uncertainty and imprecision.

Sentences can be more or less imprecise.

If know that: “Temperature is above 20ºC”, what is the truth of the following sentences: 

	1. “Temperature is 25ºC”  &rarr; Precise and uncertain 
	1. “Temperature is higher than 15ºC” &rarr; Imprecise and certain

From a set of new evidences we have to calculate the truth of a some conclusions

### Models

* Probabilistic Approach
* Quasi-probabilistic methods: Certainty Factors
* Possibilistic Approach: Fuzzy Logic
* Existential Approach: Dempster-Shafer Theory
