## Marks

* Wumpus : **95/100** 
    * Comment: The possible state should be fixed for all representations. The possible states have to depend on all objects in the environment (i.w. the number of locations, agent alive/dead, wumpus alive/dead, has an arrow or not, the gold is taken or not, etc.). The feasible states depend on your representation ( what are the states that you take in your considerations in your representation). Take care the number of feasible states should be less or equal to the possible states.

* Puzzle Game : **100/100**
