# Computational vision : Linear Filters

### Digital Images

Try to think of images as a matrices taken from a sensor array

![](img/w2/simi_1.JPG)

* Sample the 2D space on a regular grid

* Quantize each sample (round to nearest integer)

## How do we obtain color images?

Light is an energy source that carries coded information about the world which can be read from a distance through the images.

A human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to 750 nm.

## Images in Skimage

Image can be Grey-value (1 channel) or color images (3 channels)

## Spatial resolution

* **Sensor resolution**: size of real world scene element that images to a single pixel
* **Image resolution**: number of pixels

## Image Magnification

## Image reduction

## Photometric resolution

Histogram of an image represents the frequencies of the image grey levels.

## Histogram manipulation for contrast enhancement

To increase the contrast we need to apply the following:

## How to process by a lineal filter

### Image Filtering

**Linear Filtering**: Compute a function of the local neighborhood at each pixel in the image.

* Function specified by a filter or mask saying how to combine values from neighbors.

### Common types of noise

* Salt and pepper noise: random occurrences of black and white pixels.
* Impulse noise: random occurrences of white pixels
* Gaussian noise: variations in intensity drawn from a Gaussian normal distribution
* ![](img/w2/types_of_noise.JPG)

### Reducing Noise

* Firs attempt at a solution:
  * Replace each pixel with an average of all the values in its neighborhood
  * Assumptions:
    * Expect pixels to be like their neighbors
    * Expect noise processes to be independent from pixel to pixel

For each pixel i, multiply its neighborhood by a mask:

### Weighted Moving Average

### Convolutional filtering

Say the averaging windows size is (2k + 1) x (2k +1):

And for Non-uniform weights

### Properties of convolution

* Shift invariant:

  * Operator behaves the same everywhere, i.e. the value of the output depends on the pattern in the image neighborhood, not the position of the neighborhood.

* Superposition:
  $$
  h * (f1 + f2) = (h * f1) + (h * f2)
  $$
  

## Mean and median filters

Median filter is edge preserving

## Linear filters with Gaussians

2D Gaussian function
$$
h(u,v) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}e^{-\frac{u^2 + v^2}{\sigma^2}}
$$
