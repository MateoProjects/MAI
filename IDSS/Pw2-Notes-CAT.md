**Tittle**: An Intelligent decision support system from effective handling of IT projects

El desenvolupament dun projecte de software té diferents fases. En cada una d'elles es van incorporant nous requeriments. El pla de gestió es diferent en cada fase. 

Un projecte de software es considera asolit si es compleixen tots els requeriments determinats en el temps i presupost. 

El cas és que hi han varios factors que afecten en moltes fases del desenvolupament, com una incorrecte estimació del temps i cost, recursos humans necessaris etc... 

L'objectiu d'aquest estudi es: *So, the main aim of this study
is to determine the effects of these critical factors
on the output of software projects using a surveybased statistical study in developing countries*


Based on the outcome of the survey, we
also aim to propose an intelligent decision support
system through the following research questions:
RQ1. What are the main reason(s) for software
projects’ failure in developing countries?
RQ2. How to minimize the impact of negative factors on software projects through some decision
support system?

* Han revisat varios estudis i : According to their study, cost estimation is the
main factor underlying the project failure.

* En un altre: The
study showed that the main challenges in successful projects execution are cooperation among team
members and estimation of time and cost.

* En un altre: w, Cerpa and
colleagues [10] identified two major factors responsible for project failure, including unrealistic project
plan and non-appropriate estimation

* En un altre:  According
to the case study of 202 software projects, unrealistic
project goals, lack of resources, executive support and
inappropriate planning are the main reasons behind
software development failure

**Framework**

H1: Improper project planning has a positive
impact on software project failure.
H2: Inadequate human resource practice has a
positive impact on software project failure.
H3: Poor estimation of time has a positive impact
on software project failure.
H4: Poor estimation of cost has a positive impact
on software project failure.

Han dividit l'investigacio en diverses fases:

* The first phase was problem identification
and motivation to investigate and formulate
research questions.

*) The second phase consisted of two activities: In
the first activity, data from already completed
software projects were gathered from different software companies in Pakistan through
an online questionnaire. In the second activity,
the collected data were analyzed to understand
the decision making process during software
development. The relevant experts were also
identified who was involved in the decisionmaking process during development.

 The third phase consisted of two activities:
In a first activity, a model was developed for
intelligent decision support system. Intelligent
decision support system has activated for scrum
master, and various agents work together to produce a quality estimate. The second activity of
phase 3 was to answer the research questions.

According to this approach, there are
five main components; (1) multi-agents based recommender system, (2) ontology knowledge base system,
(3) Knowledge creation, (4) Knowledge tree maintenance and (5) integrating and mapping third-party
