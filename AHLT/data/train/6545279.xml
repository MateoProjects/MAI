    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d24.s6" text="Whenever increased thioether excretion is observed, it is likely to be due to exposure to one or more suspect compounds. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d24.s7" text="However, when the thioether concentration ranges within the limits of the normal value, one must not conclude that there is no, or negligible, exposure. "/>
