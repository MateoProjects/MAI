    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d136.s1" text="At low-levels of exposure the toxicokinetic interferences between solvents have generally not been observed in man and presumably a threshold limit exists. "/>

    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d136.s4" text="Toxicodynamic interference between solvents can give rise to additive, potentiation, synergistic, antagonistic effects. "/>
    <sentence id="DDI-MedLine.d136.s5" text="For the identification of &quot;limit values&quot;, it has generally been suggested in the literature that the possible effects deriving from multiple exposure be considered as additive. "/>
